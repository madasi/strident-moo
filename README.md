## Ward Career Day Demo Program

A python OS X specific program I wrote to use as a demo for a career day presentation I was asked to give.

Concept taken from Michigan Council of Women in Technology's excellent presentation of [Career Day Speaker Tips](https://www.mcwt.org/files/mcwt2012/1/file/foundation/MCWTF%20Parents%20and%20Teachers%20Docs/Career%20Day%20Speaker%20Tips_Oct2013.pdf) which sourced the idea from [Katie Fulton Cunningham's blog](http://therealkatie.net/blog/2012/oct/24/career-day/).

I wrote this in a hurry, literally right before I gave the presentation, so I quickly gave up on trying to use a python library for the text-to-speech and reluctantly fell back to the dirty hack of `system('say Lorem ipsum')` instead.

I also failed to setup source control for the same reason, which I do regret. The kids enjoyed the program, largely due to the speaking, and really liked the chance to change what it said to them when run. Since I did not have it versioned, I had to try to roll back the speech to the original strings in the tiny time window as the groups rotated between presenters, and I do not have a record of what each group chose. The current form of the program is after the last group got to have fun with it.
